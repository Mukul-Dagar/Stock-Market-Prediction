INTRODUCTION -
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that analyses historical
stock prices and key indicators to estimate future stock trends. By leveraging
techniques such as time series analysis, LSTM neural networks, and technical
indicators, the system seeks to assist investors and traders in making informed
decisions. The goal is to explore the potential of AI-driven models in capturing
market patterns and improving the accuracy of stock price forecasts.

For fetching stock market data Yfinance module has been used.
